# BasicTCR

Basic token curated registry implementation inspired by Mike Goldin and @gautamdhameja's implementations

# Features

The following simple flow is implemented here,

1. Initialize a TCR with a token
2. Apply for a listing
3. Challenge an applied/whitelisted listing
4. Vote on a challenge (without commit-reveal)
5. Update status of a listing (resolve challenge)
6. Claim rewards after a challenge is resolved (based on a hard-coded formula)
